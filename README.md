# Homeofgames
Home of Games is a web-based system to manage and access video games with ease for users.
The system provides a user friendly platform which simplifies the search and rating reviews of different video games for different platforms in one place.
This Project was inspired because:
The search for the next good video game is tedious and time taking
Finding games for different platforms is found in different places
Filtering the kind of games was exhausting
